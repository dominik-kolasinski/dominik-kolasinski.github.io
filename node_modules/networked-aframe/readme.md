Getting Started
---------------

Follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/haydenjameslee/networked-aframe/blob/master/docs/Tutorial:%20Create%20your%20first%20Networked-Aframe%20experience.md) to build your own example.

Edit online example with [glitch.com/~networked-aframe](https://glitch.com/~networked-aframe).

To get the examples running on your own PC run:

 ```sh
git clone https://github.com/haydenjameslee/networked-aframe.git  # Clone the repository.
cd networked-aframe
npm install && npm run easyrtc-install  # Install dependencies.
npm run dev  # Start the local development server.
```
With the server running, browse the examples at `http://localhost:8080`. Open another browser tab and point it to the same URL to see the other client.


Basic Example
-------------
```html
<html>
  <head>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/networked-aframe/dist/networked-aframe.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      function onConnect () {
        NAF.entities.createAvatar('#avatar-template', '0 1.6 0', '0 0 0');
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene network-scene>
      <a-assets>
        <script id="avatar-template" type="text/html">

        </script>
      </a-assets>
    </a-scene>

Documentation

### Overview

Networked-Aframe works by syncing entities and their components to connected users. To connect to a room you need to add the [`network-scene`](#scene-component) component to the `a-scene` element. For an entity to be synced, you need to create a [network entity](#creating-network-entities). By default the `position` and `rotation` components are synced, but if you want to sync other components or child components you need to define a [schema](#syncing-custom-components). For more advanced control over the WebRTC datachannel see the sections on [Broadcasting Custom Messages](#broadcasting-custom-messages) and [Options](#options).


### Scene component

Required on the A-Frame `<a-scene>` component.

```html
<a-scene network-scene="
  app: <appId>;
  room: <roomName>;
  audio: false;
  debug: false;
  onConnect: onConnect;
  connectOnLoad: true;
  signalURL: /;
">
  ...
</a-scene>
```

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| app  | Unique app name. Spaces are not allowed. | default |
| room  | Unique room name. Can be multiple per app. Spaces are not allowed. | default |
| audio  | Turn on / off microphone audio streaming for your app | false |
| debug  | Turn on / off Networked-Aframe debug logs | false |
| onConnect  | Function to be called when client has successfully connected to the server | onConnect |
| connectOnLoad  | Connect to the server as soon as the webpage loads  | true |
| signalURL  | Choose where the WebRTC signaling server is located | / |


### Creating Network Entities

```javascript
NAF.entities.createAvatar(template, position, rotation)
```

Create an avatar that follows your camera's movements. Should only be called once. The avatar is hidden for you but visible for other players.

```javascript

NAF.entities.createNetworkEntity(template, position, rotation)
```
Create an instance of a template to be synced across clients. The position and rotation will be synced by default. The [`aframe-lerp-component`](https://github.com/haydenjameslee/aframe-lerp-component) is added to allow for less network updates while keeping smooth motion.

| Parameter | Description
| -------- | -----------
| template  | A css selector to a script tag stored in `<a-assets>` - [Template documentation](https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/template)
| position  | An A-Frame position string for the initial position of the entity, eg. '0 0 0'
| rotation  | An A-Frame rotation string for the initial rotation of the entity, eg '0 45 0'


### Deleting Network Entities

Currently only the creator of a network entity can delete it. To delete, simply delete the element from the HTML and Networked-Aframe will handle the syncing automatically.


### Syncing Custom Components

By default, the A-Frame `position` and `rotation` components on the root entity are synced when a network entity is created.

To sync other components and components of child entities you need to define a schema per template. Here's how to define and add a schema:

```javascript
var avatarSchema = {
  template: '#avatar-template',
  components: [
    'position',
    'rotation',
    'scale',
    {
      selector: '.head',
      component: 'material'
    },
    {
      selector: '.hairs',
      component: 'show-child'
    }
  ]
};
NAF.schemas.add(avatarSchema);
```

Components of the root entity can be defined with the name of the component. Components of child entities can be defined with an object with both the `selector` field, which uses a standard CSS selector to be used by `document.querySelector`, and the `component` field which specifies the name of the component.

Once you've defined the schema then add it to the list of schemas by calling `NAF.schemas.add(YOUR_SCHEMA)`.

Component data is retrieved by the A-Frame `getData` function. During the network tick each component's data is checked against its previous synced value; if the data object has changed at all it will be synced across the network.


### Broadcasting Custom Messages

```javascript
NAF.connection.subscribeToDataChannel(dataType, callback)
NAF.connection.unsubscribeToDataChannel(dataType)
NAF.connection.broadcastData(dataType, data)
NAF.connection.broadcastDataGuaranteed(dataType, data)
```

Subscribe and unsubscribe callbacks to network messages specified by `dataType`. Send messages to other clients with the `broadcastData` functions.

`broadcastData` messages are sent P2P using UDP and are not guaranteed to make it to other clients (although they will most of the time, [see why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol)). `broadcastDataGuaranteed` messages are currently sent via the websocket connection to the server using TCP, and hence not using WebRTC at all. These messages are guaranteed to be delivered to all connected clients. In the future a reliable protocol may be added on top of UDP instead of relying on the TCP websocket connection.

| Parameter | Description
| -------- | -----------
| dataType  | String to identify a network message. `u` is a reserved data type, don't use it pls
| callback  | Function to be called when message of type `dataType` is received.
| data | Object to be sent to all other clients


### Misc

```javascript
NAF.connection.isConnected()
```

Returns true if a connection has been established to the signalling server. Don't create entities before this is true.


### Options

```javascript
NAF.options.updateRate
```

Frequency the network component `sync` function is called, per second. 10-20 is normal for most Social VR applications. Default is `15`.

```javascript
NAF.options.useLerp
```

By default when an entity is created the [`aframe-lerp-component`](https://github.com/haydenjameslee/aframe-lerp-component) is attached to smooth out position and rotation network updates. Set this to false if you don't want the lerp component to be attached on creation.

```javascript
NAF.options.compressSyncPackets
```

Compress each sync packet into a minimized but harder to read JSON object for saving bandwidth. Default is `false`.

To measure bandwidth usage, run two clients on Chrome and visit chrome://webrtc-internals
